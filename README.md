# EXTRACTING DATA FROM AN HTML SOURCE CODE

This library uses html parser to identify duplicated codes from a html file, extract information from the file and convert the data into pandas dataframe or excel format. It makes use of famous library, including beautifulsoup, pandas, tabulate, ... and aims to make web scrapping easier for data scientists.

The program works well with well-formated HTML/HTML5 webpage, and examples of its usage can be found in the library. The library is still in development, and I hope to add more features and restructure the library in the near future.
